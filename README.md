### When Going to do Work
!! Create a NEW BRANCH !!
It is very important that you create a new branch to work on, this will prevent issues with pushing your code to the Repo.


### When Happy With Changes Made
Create merge/pull request to the main branch, I will review it and accept it. Then your code will be reflected on the main repository
